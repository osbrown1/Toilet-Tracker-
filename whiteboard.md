/////// Talking points for presentation:

- We started with googlemaps for our mapping api and learned that map api's are not only difficult, but google has poor documentation. 
- We switched to different map api's for a few days, 'cartes' and 'uebermaps', struggling to find one that works for us. 
- For those first few days of failing to make our map display and function, we were making progress in understanding how map api's work.
- We ended up using Leaflet for our API.
- Even our working API gave so many errors that we had to disable eslint in order to use our webpage. It was par for the course for how tricky map api's are.
